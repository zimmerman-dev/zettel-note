### 🔼 Increments & Decrements

1. Declare an integer `i` with the value `5` and increment it using the **prefix** operator.

2. Declare an integer `j` with the value `10` and increment it using the **postfix** operator.

3. Write a statement that decrements `count` by 1 using the prefix form.

4. Write a statement that uses the postfix decrement on `k` and assigns its value to `m`.

5. What is the difference in behavior between `++x` and `x++` when used inside an expression?

### ❓ Conditionals

6. Write an `if` statement that checks if `temperature` is greater than `100` and prints `"Overheated!"`.

7. Extend that with an `else` block that prints `"Normal"` when `temperature` is not greater than `100`.

8. Write an `if-else if-else` chain that:
   - Prints `"Negative"` if `num` is less than 0.
   - Prints `"Zero"` if `num` equals 0.
   - Prints `"Positive"` otherwise.

9. Write a conditional expression (ternary operator) that sets `status` to `"Pass"` if `score` is at least 60, otherwise `"Fail"`.

10. Write a condition that checks if `x` is outside the range 10 to 20 (exclusive) using a single `if` with `||`.

### 🔁 Loops

11. Write a `for` loop that prints numbers 1 to 5.

12. Write a `while` loop that prints `"Counting..."` while `counter` is less than 10.

13. Write a `do-while` loop that prints `"At least once"` even if `flag` is `false`.

14. Write a `for` loop that starts at `i = 10` and decrements to 1.

15. Write a `while` loop that multiplies `n` by 2 until it’s greater than 100.

---

### 🧩 Combined Practice

16. Using a `for` loop, print only even numbers from 2 to 10.

17. Write a loop that asks for user input repeatedly until the user enters `0`.

18. Using a `while` loop and a counter, print `"Looping"` exactly 3 times.

19. Write a loop that uses `break` to exit when `x` equals `7`.

20. Write a loop that uses `continue` to skip printing the value `3` when iterating from 1 to 5.
