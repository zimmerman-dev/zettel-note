# C++, Embedded Systems & AI-Aware Development

## 🗓️ Month 1–2: C++ Fundamentals (with Depth)
**Objective:** Build solid, low-level foundations the AI can’t fake.

### Topics:
- Pointers, references, memory allocation, RAII
- Constructors/destructors, const correctness
- Standard containers: `std::vector`, `std::map`
- File I/O, command-line input

### Projects:
- Contact manager using arrays and then `std::vector`
- Command-line calculator using pointer arithmetic

### Tools:
- `g++`, `CMake`, terminal workflows

---

## 🗓️ Month 3–4: Embedded & Systems Intro
**Objective:** Learn how software touches hardware.

### Platform:
- Arduino Uno, ESP32, or STM32

### Topics:
- GPIO, PWM, interrupts, debouncing
- Serial communication

### Projects:
- Smart temperature logger with SD card storage
- Optional: Add shell-style serial control

### Tools:
- `avr-gcc`, `platformio`, or `arduino-cli`

---

## 🗓️ Month 5–6: Algorithms, Data Structures, and Optimization
**Objective:** Think like a systems designer, not a script kid.

### Topics:
- Sorting algorithms, binary trees, hash tables
- Graphs and pathfinding (e.g., A*)
- Big-O analysis, benchmarking, inline assembly

### Projects:
- Pathfinding simulation (A* on a grid)
- Memory profiler for allocation counting

---

## 🗓️ Month 7–8: Real-Time Systems / Game-Like Architecture
**Objective:** Learn timing, loops, and how to structure reactive programs.

### Topics:
- Game loops, delta timing, fixed-step simulation
- Entity-Component-System (ECS) basics

### Projects:
- Simple "Space Invaders" clone using SDL or `ncurses`
- Add physics or collision system

### Bonus:
- Port to a microcontroller with OLED display

---

## 🗓️ Month 9–10: AI Integration (Light)
**Objective:** Use AI models in C++ projects without being a full ML engineer.

### Topics:
- Basics of ML (classification, regression)
- Model inference using ONNX Runtime or TensorFlow Lite
- Communicating between C++ and Python (e.g., sockets or bindings)

### Projects:
- MNIST digit recognizer with C++ frontend
- Bonus: Sensor-based input (e.g., drawing numbers on touchscreen)

---

## 🗓️ Month 11–12: Specialization + Portfolio
**Objective:** Make something bold. Push your stack.

### Choose a Focus:
- Embedded robotics: Line-following drone, motion-tracking camera
- Game tech: Raycaster, physics engine, ECS framework
- Security: Disassembler, sandboxed exploit demo

### Final Goals:
- Public GitHub project with clean commits and documentation
- README, diagrams, and maybe a blog or devlog

---

## 🧰 Tools You’ll Pick Up Along the Way
- `g++`, `make`, `cmake`
- `platformio`, `arduino-cli`, `avrdude`
- `SDL2`, `ncurses`, `OpenGL`
- Python, scikit-learn, ONNX, TensorFlow Lite

---

## 🔥 Bonus Meta-Skills
- `gdb`, Valgrind, logic analyzers for debugging
- Git workflows (feature branches, GitHub Actions)
- Writing documentation like your future self will depend on it
