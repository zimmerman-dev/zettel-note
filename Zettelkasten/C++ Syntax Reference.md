# 📘 C++ Syntax Reference

A concise, topic-driven reference for fundamental C++ syntax, with links to more detailed notes on each concept. See [[C++ Basics]].

---

## 🧱 Core Building Blocks

- [[Statements and Expressions]]  
  → Learn how C++ programs are structured at the smallest level.

- [[Operators]]  
  → Arithmetic, logical, relational, assignment, and more.

- [[Data Types]]  
  → Primitive types (`int`, `float`, `char`, etc.) and user-defined types.

- [[Variables and Constants]]  
  → Declaring, initializing, and using `const` and `constexpr`.

- [[Functions]]  
  → Syntax, arguments, return types, and function overloading.

---

## 🧮 Control Flow

- [[Conditionals]]  
  → `if`, `else`, `switch`, ternary operator

- [[Loops]]  
  → `for`, `while`, `do-while`, range-based loops

- [[Jump Statements]]  
  → `break`, `continue`, `return`, `goto`

---

## 🧠 Advanced Basics

- [[Pointers and References]]  
  → Address-of (`&`), dereference (`*`), and memory basics

- [[Arrays]]   &  [[Vectors]]  
  → Static and dynamic collections

- [[Scope and Lifetime]]  
  → Block scope, global scope, static duration

- [[Preprocessor Directives]]  
  → `#include`, `#define`, `#pragma once`

---

## 🧰 Object-Oriented Tools

- [[Classes and Objects]]  
  → Defining and using classes

- [[Constructors and Destructors]]  
  → Object lifecycle syntax

- [[Access Modifiers]]  
  → `public`, `private`, `protected`

- [[Inheritance and Polymorphism]]  
  → Base classes, virtual functions, and overrides

---

## 🧪 Additional Features

- [[Namespaces]]  
  → Avoiding name collisions

- [[Templates and Generics]]  
  → Generic programming syntax (`template<typename T>`)

- [[Operator Overloading]]  
  → Custom operator behavior

- [[Exception Handling]]  
  → `try`, `catch`, `throw`

- [[Type Casting]]  
  → `static_cast`, `dynamic_cast`, `reinterpret_cast`
