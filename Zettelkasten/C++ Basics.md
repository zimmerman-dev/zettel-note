### What is C++?

**C++ is a cross platform language that can be used to create high performance applications.**

### Difference between C++ and C?

C++ was developed as an extension of [[C]], and they share the almost the same syntax. The main difference between C and C++ is that C++ supports [[Classes and Objects|classes]] and [[Objects|objects]], while C does not.

### The Structure of a C++ Program

**Basic Components "Syntax":**
- [[C++ Headers Index|Header file Libraries]] contain declarations of functions, classes. data types, and macros. The way to call those libraries for a program is using the "#include" preprocessor directive, which is described below.
- [[Namespaces|using namespace std]] or Namespaces in general, are just containers that groups related code together - like functions, variables, or classes. For example, assume two different libraries you call both have a function called "foo". The compiler wont know which function you meant unless you qualify it. 
- [[Functions|int main()]] or "the main function" is always present at the starting point of the program. 
- *return 0;* ends the function.
- Comments are human readable notes inside the source code. The comments never make it to the compiler.
- [[Iostream|Basic I/O]] means basic input and output streams to and from the console. In other words, I/O is how the user communicates with the program.
