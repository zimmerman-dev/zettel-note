## ➿ **What are Loops?**


 Loops are part of the third basic building block of programming, **iteration.** Iteration, or repetition allows the execution of a statement or block of statements repeatedly. These loops are made up of "loop conditions" and a body which contains the statements to repeat.

---
### ✅ **Universal Concepts**

- **Loop Control Variable** – governs iteration and determines when the loop stops.

- **Condition** – checked each iteration to decide whether to continue.

- **Body** – the statements executed on each iteration.

---

### ❗ **Common Pitfalls**

- Forgetting to update the loop control variable (can cause infinite loops).
    
- Using the wrong condition (off-by-one errors).
    
- Modifying a container incorrectly while iterating.

---

### 🎛️ **Control Statements**

- `break` – exits the loop early.

- `continue` – skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next.

- `return` – exits the entire function, not just the loop.

### 📚 **Loop Types**

#### [[Loops - For |For Loops]] – Controlled iteration with explicit index handling.
#### [[Loops - Ranged-based For | Ranged based For loops]] – Simplified iteration over containers.
#### [[Loops - While | While Loops]] – Runs as long as a condition is true.
#### [[Loops - Do While | Do while loops]] – Similar to while, but executes at least once.


### 🔹 **`while` Loop**

```cpp
while
```

#### How it works:

A while loop Iterates *while* a condition remains true, and stops when the condition becomes false. This means the loop checks the condition at the beginning of every iteration.
    
- Typical use cases:  

    
---
### 🔹 **`do-while` Loop**

```cpp
```

#### How it works:

A do-while loop operates like a while loop. It iterates while a condition remains true and stops when the condition becomes false; however, it checks the condition at the end of every iteration.
