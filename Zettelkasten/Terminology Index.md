### ==A==

- `Assignment` - Giving a variable a new value after it's already been declared.

- `Argument` - The actual value passed into a function when it's called. (Compare with *Parameter*).

- `Abstraction` -  The process of generalizing concrete details and handling complexity as to hide unnecessary details from the user.
---
### ==B==

- `Base Case` - The condition in a recursive function that stops the further recursive calls.
---
### ==C==

- `Call Stack` - The structure used by the program to track function calls, including recursive ones. Each call adds a frame, and *frame*, and each `return` pops one off.

- `Const` - A keyword that marks something as immutable (can't be changed).

- `Control Flow` - Simply, the order in which code is executed--influenced by conditionals, loops, and function calls.
---
### ==D==

- `Declaration` - Tells the compiler that a variable or function exists, but doesn't define it. 

- `Definition` - Actually creates the variable or function and allocates memory.

- `Dereference` - Accessing the value a pointer points to, using the `*` operator.
---
### ==E==

- `Expression` - A combination of values, variables, or operators that produce a value.
---
### ==F==

---
### ==G==

---
### ==H==

---
### ==I==

- `Initialization` - Assigning a value at the time of definition. 

-  `Iteration` - Repeating a task using a loop (`for`, `while`, etc.), instead of recursion.

- `Identifier` - The name you give to variables or functions.
---
### ==J==

---
### ==K==

---
### ==L==

- `Lvalue` - "Locator value" refers to a memory location and can appear on the left-hand side of an assignment. `in x = 5; // x is an lvalue` 
---
### ==M==

---
### ==N==

- `Null Pointer` - A pointer that points to nothing (`nullptr`). Safer than an uninitialized pointer.
---
### ==O==

---
### ==P==

- `Parameter` - The placeholder variable in a function definition. (Compare with *Argument*).

- `Pointer` - A variable that holds a memory address, e.g., *think symlink*.
---
### ==Q==

---
### ==R==

- `Recursion` - When a function calls itself to solve a smaller version of a problem. Needs a *Base Case*.

- `Reference` - An alias to an existing variable. Can't be reseated once initialized.

- `Return` - The exit point of a function. Sends a value back to the caller.

- `Rvalue` - "Right hand side value" refers to a temporary value that doesn't occupy a persistent memory location `x = 5;  // 5 is and rvalue`
---
### ==S==

- `Statement` - A syntactic unit of an imperative programming language that expresses some action to be carried out.
---
### ==T==

---
### ==U==

- `Undefined Behavior (UB)` - Code the compiles but causes unpredictable results at runtime. Anything goes.
---
### ==V==

- `Variable` - A named container storing a value.
---
### ==W==

---
### ==X==

---
### ==Y==

---
### ==Z==
