# 🗂️ zettel-note

This repository contains my **Obsidian vault** – a collection of interconnected notes, ideas, and references managed using the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) knowledge base app.

## 📖 About
The vault follows a **Zettelkasten-inspired** approach, where notes are atomic, linked, and easy to expand upon.
It serves as both a personal knowledge base and a version-controlled backup.

## 🛠️ Structure
- `*.md` – Core notes written in Markdown.
- `.obsidian/` – Obsidian configuration, themes, and plugin settings (UI state is ignored in `.gitignore`).
- `.gitignore` – Excludes cache files and machine-specific artifacts.

## 🚀 Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zimmerman-dev/zettel-note.git
